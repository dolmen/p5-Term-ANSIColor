The ansicolor and vt100-torture files in this directory were written by
Joe Smith to test terminals for support of various VT100 escape sequences.
ansicolor is of the most interest in developing this package, but
vt100-torture also tests some of the other attributes this module
supports.

The color256-* files are generated by the generate-256 script, originally
written by Kurt Starsinic (and then heavily modified by Russ Allbery, who
probably introduced any bugs).  They show all the possible RGB colors for
foreground or background, all the grey-scale colors, and the base 16 ANSI
colors using the 256-color syntax.

To use one of these files, you should be able to display it in your
terminal with cat.  These tests may be useful in expanding the table of
supported terminal emulators in the Term::ANSIColor documentation.
